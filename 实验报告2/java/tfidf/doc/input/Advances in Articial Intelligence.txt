Advances in Arti®cial Intelligence
Special Issue on
Deep Learning Methods and Applications
CALL FOR PAPERS
Deep Learning Methods and Applications provide an overview of general deep
learning methodology and its applications to a variety of signal and information
processing tasks. It is a new area of Machine Learning research, which has been
introduced with the objective of moving Machine Learning closer to one of its
original goals: Articial Intelligence. Deep Learning is about learningmultiple levels
of representation and abstraction that help to make sense of data such as images,
sound, and text.
e literature on deep learning is vast, mostly coming from the machine learning
community.e signal processing community embraced deep learning only within
the past four years or so (starting around end of 2009) and themomentum is growing
fast ever since.
Potential topics include, but are not limited to:
Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning
Deep learning representation (unsupervised, semisupervised, and
supervised)
Optimization for representation learning
Deep learning for big data
Sparse modeling and hierarchical models
Deep learning algorithms for 2D and 3D visual data representation and
analysis
Distributed computing, GPUs, and new hardware for deep learning
Applications in vision, audio, speech, and natural language processing,
robotics, and neuroscience with deep architectures
Virtual and augmented reality application
Big Data application
Neuromorphic platforms
